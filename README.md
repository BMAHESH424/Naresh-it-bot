# 🎓 AI-Powered Course Assistant Chatbot

An intelligent **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** chatbot built using **Google Gemini, LangChain, FAISS, and Streamlit** to help students explore NareshIT course information through natural conversations.

Instead of relying on hardcoded responses, the application dynamically retrieves course content from official NareshIT course pages, indexes it into a vector database, and generates context-aware answers using Google's Gemini Large Language Model.

# Workflow

### Step 1

User selects a course.

Example:

- Full Stack Python
- Data Science & AI
- Java
- Django
- Power BI

---

### Step 2

The application loads the official NareshIT course webpage.

---

### Step 3

The webpage content is split into semantic chunks using RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter.

---

### Step 4

Each chunk is converted into vector embeddings using Gemini Embedding-001.

---

### Step 5

Embeddings are stored inside a FAISS vector database.

---

### Step 6

When a user asks a question:

- Similar chunks are retrieved
- Relevant context is injected into the prompt
- Gemini generates an accurate response grounded on retrieved information

---

### Step 7

The response can optionally be:

- translated into multiple languages
- converted into speech
- exported as Markdown or JSON

---

# Supported Courses

- Full Stack Python
- Full Stack Data Science & AI
- Java Full Stack
- .NET Full Stack
- Django
- Spring Boot
- React UI Full Stack
- Tableau
- Power BI
- MySQL

# Key Functionalities

## Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

Instead of asking Gemini directly, the chatbot first retrieves the most relevant course content and then generates answers using retrieved context.

This significantly reduces hallucinations and improves answer accuracy.

---

## Dynamic Course Loading

The chatbot does not use static datasets.

It automatically fetches the latest course content from NareshIT webpages.

---

## Multilingual Support

Users can receive answers in multiple languages including:

- English
- Hindi
- Telugu
- Tamil
- Kannada
- Malayalam
- Bengali
- Gujarati
- Marathi
- Punjabi
- Urdu

---

## Voice Features

- Speech-to-Text using SpeechRecognition
- Text-to-Speech using Google TTS

---

## Conversation Export

Users can download chat history as:

- JSON
- Markdown

---

## Session Management

Each course maintains its own independent conversation history using Streamlit Session State.
